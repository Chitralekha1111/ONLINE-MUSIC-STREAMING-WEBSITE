# ONLINE-MUSIC-STREAMING-WEBSITE
ü The objective of “ONLINE MUSIC STREAMING WEBSITE” is to create a
materialized, responsive and secure music player that goes all the way to do
almost anything you would want from an interactive music player. 

ü This website is a collection of songs from different languages in one place at free
of cost only to provide a user-friendly interface for streaming music. It is an
interactive, intuitive and dynamic online music player. 

ü There are seamless UI transitions which make the whole user experience very user
friendly and easy to use. Also various animations and partial effects are used
throughout the website to make it look delightful. 

ü The whole website is responsive as well, meaning it would look good and run fine on
devices of all screen sizes ranging from mobiles to laptops.

ü The website have the features such as play, shuffle, repeat, loop and skip songs.
It also have a volume adjustment option. 

ü Several approaches have been made to enhance the users listening experience, while most
of them rely on the music content provided by the user, this project presents
an online application that sources the audio content from publicly available
resources. 

ü With the increasing playlist and song selection, a good music player that can play
songs online is a must. Nothing is better than that for an audiophile.
